1. General Description
Dungeon Explorer is a single-player, text-based (or optionally GUI-based) RPG where the player navigates through interconnected rooms in a dungeon, battles enemies, collects items, and progresses through multiple levels of increasing difficulty. The primary goal is to survive each level, defeat or avoid enemies, and gather valuable items and treasures.

- Game Objectives:  
  1. Provide an engaging exploration and combat experience.  
  2. Allow players to manage resources (health, items) strategically.  
  3. Offer a scalable foundation for additional features like puzzles, story elements, or multiplayer in the future.

- Scope:  
  - Initially focuses on core dungeon-crawling mechanics (movement, combat, inventory).  
  - May expand to include puzzles, boss battles, or optional graphical interfaces.

 2. System Requirements

 Functional Requirements
1. Player Movement  
   - The system must allow the player to move within the dungeon (north, south, east, west).  
   - Movement should be restricted by walls or locked doors until specific conditions (keys, puzzles) are met.

2. Combat Mechanics  
   - The system must handle turn-based or real-time combat between the player and enemies.  
   - Enemies should have distinct behaviors (e.g., patrol, aggressive, passive).

3. Item Management  
   - The system must allow players to pick up, drop, and use items.  
   - Items can include weapons, potions, and special artifacts with unique effects.

4. Dungeon Layout  
   - The dungeon consists of multiple rooms connected by doors or corridors.  
   - Each room can contain enemies, items, or special events (like traps).

5. Game Progression  
   - The system must track player progress (health, items, experience/levels).  
   - The game ends when the player’s health reaches zero or when they complete the final level.

 Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance  
   - The game should run smoothly on standard desktop environments.  
   - Memory usage should remain moderate, even with large dungeon layouts.

2. Platform  
   - Must compile and run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
   - Uses standard C++17 (or higher) features to maintain portability.

3. Code Standards & Maintainability  
   - Follow consistent naming conventions, clear file organization, and minimal global variables.  
   - Provide documentation comments for all major classes, methods, and systems.

4. Scalability  
   - Architecture should accommodate adding new dungeon levels, enemy types, and game mechanics without extensive refactoring.
