### Test Plan Description


#### Objectives:
- Verify that all game components work together seamlessly.
- Ensure the game flow is consistent and bug-free.
- Test for edge cases such as invalid inputs or unexpected player actions.
- Confirm that saving and loading the game state works correctly.

#### Test Cases:

1. Character Selection:
   - Test: Ensure the player can select Warrior, Mage, or Rogue.
   - Expected Result: The correct character instance is created and initialized with the proper attributes.

2. Room Interaction:
   - Test: Verify that entering a room displays the correct description and handles the presence of enemies or NPCs.
   - Expected Result: The enter() method of the Room class is called, and the room’s contents are displayed accurately.

3. Combat System:
   - Test: Simulate combat interactions, including player and enemy turns.
   - Expected Result: Damage calculations and actions are executed correctly, and combat ends when either the player or enemy is defeated.

4. Inventory System:
   - Test: Add items to the inventory and use them during gameplay.
   - Expected Result: Items are added correctly, and using them results in the desired effect (e.g., restoring health).

5. Dungeon Navigation:
   - Test: Explore the dungeon by entering the single room.
   - Expected Result: The explore() and enter() methods are called, and the game transitions to the room view.

6. Saving and Loading:
   - Test: Save the game at various points and reload the saved state.
   - Expected Result: The game state is saved and restored accurately, allowing the player to continue where they left off.

7. Game Flow:
   - Test: Play through the game from start to finish, testing transitions between different components (e.g., room to combat).
   - Expected Result: The game flow is smooth, and there are no crashes or logical errors.

8. Error Handling:
   - Test: Input invalid commands or data during gameplay.
   - Expected Result: The game provides appropriate error messages or responses without crashing.

#### Tools/Methods:
- Manual Testing: Simulate different player actions to verify the game’s behavior.
- Automated Unit Testing: Test individual methods and classes (e.g., addItem(), `engage()`).
- Integration Testing: Ensure all components work together as intended.
